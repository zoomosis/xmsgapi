Although MSGAPI is copyrighted, you have been granted a limited licence
modify or to use MSGAPI in your applications.  The only restrictions on
the use of MsgAPI are:

1) This code must not be sold.  Permission to post this file on "pay
   BBSes" is granted, as long as no extra fee (above and beyond the
   normal access charges) is required to download or access this code.
      
2) If you use this code in your application, you are required to give
   credit for the MsgAPI code, and you must also indicate that "Squish"
   is a trademark of Scott J. Dudley.
	    
3) If you modify this code, you must keep the message format compatible.
   If my original MsgAPI code cannot read from AND write to message
   areas created by your modified code, you may not label your
   application as being compatible with the Squish message format.
      
   Aside from the above, there are few restrictions on the use of the
   MSGAPI0 code.  As long as the above conditions are followed, MSGAPI
   may be incorporated into any type of application, commercial or

Distribution Policy

Although the MsgAPI code is copyrighted, you are granted a limited
license to modify or usr MsgAPI in your own applications.

1) You may use the MsgAPI code as part of any type of application,
including freeware, shareware, or commercial programs. No royalties or
licensing fees are required.

2) This code must not be sold on its own. While it  is permissible to
sell an application that uses or contains the MsgAPI code, you may not
charge any extra fee (above  the base cost of the product) for just
providing the user with a copy of the Squish Developers kit.

Also, you may not charge any extra fee (above the base cost of the
product) for providing Squish base support within your program.

3) If you use this code in your application, you must give credit for
the MsgAPI code and indicate that "Squish"  is a trademark of SCI
Communications.

4) If you wish to identify your application as being compatible with the
Squish message format, you must ensure that the original MsgAPI code is
capable of reading and writing to the message bases that are created by
your program. If the original MsgAPI code is unable to read the files
created by your program, you may not label your program as Squish-
compatible.

As long as the above four conditions are followed, MsgAPI may be
incorporated into any type of application without charge, regardless of
the nature of the application (commercial, shareware, or freeware).
