	* unix/gnu-c/makefile: added putword.o which was accidentally
	left out and added -DUNIX.

	* compiler.h: #ifdef __Linux__ changed to #ifdef __linux__.

	* VERSION moved to src/xmapiver.h.

	* "MSGA *sq" changed to "HAREA ha" in struct _msgh in msgapi.h as per
	SQDEV200.  Other changes made accordingly.  This shouldn't break any
	applications unless they access _msgh directly (they shouldn't).

	* Added pragma to pack.h/unpack.h to stop Borland C++ 5.3 complaining
	about structure	packing.

	* SquishFillBaseHeader() optimised.  The basename is no longer written
	to the .sqd file (there is no rationale for doing this and it only
	adds confusion later if you rename the file).

	* In SMAPI 2.x, the FTSC date field of a message would be generated
	if none was present.  This is not the purpose of the field.  It
	should only be filled when a message is tossed into the base, and
	otherwise set to nul.  Squish applications should use the binary
	timestamps (date_written and date_arrived) instead.  Please read
	SQDEV.PRN (part of SQDEV200) for more information.  This code has
	been removed from sq_write.c.

	* Bug fix: changed "typedef int bits;" to "typedef unsigned int bits;"
	for __TURBOC__ and moved to typedefs.h.  Changed "typedef int bit;"
	to "typedef unsigned int bit;"

	* XMSGAPI_VERSION define now located in src\..\VERSION.

	* LITTLE_ENDIAN no longer assumed in GNU C UNIX makefile.

	* Removed HISTORY file.

	* XMSGAPI 1.5 released.

	* Don't panic!  Bug fix to NumKludges() in msgapi.c.

	* XMSGAPI 1.2 released.

2003-01-17 Friday 15:05  ozzmosis

	* All compilers where support was planned are now supported.

	* XMSGAPI 1.1 released.

	* typedef struct MSG renamed to MSGA.

	* _get_osfhandle(3) returns -1 in MingW32.  This is probably a bug in
	MingW32.  If it works for you, add -DFIXED_GET_OSFHANDLE to the CDEFS
	part of the MingW32 makefile and recompile.

	* Watcom C (Win32) now supported too!

	* Digital Mars C is now supported.  The MingW32 port seems to have has
	a broken waitlock2() causing it to call lock() infinitely.  I don't
	know how to fix this.  A dummy function is in its place.

	* The project has "forked" and has been renamed to XMSGAPI
	(eXtended MsgAPI).  Code changes have taken place to support
	additional compilers and platforms.  Only a few compilers are
	currently supported at this stage!  They are: Microsoft Visual C++
	6.0, Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0, Intel C++ 6.0, Borland C++ Builder
	3.0, Borland C++ 5.5.1 & GNU C (Cygwin).  Source files have been
	cleaned up by hand & with "indent".
