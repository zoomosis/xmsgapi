Notes

- 16-bit DOS and 16-bit OS/2 will not be supported.

- To compile XMSGAPI for UNIX or BeOS, the UNIX makefile and all related
  source files should be in UNIX text file format (linefeeds only, no
  carriage returns).  In particular, GNU C complains about carriage
  returns in #if expressions that continue on from the previous line, ie.

  #if defined(AAA) || \ <CR>
    defined(BBB)

- There is no makefile to generate a DLL version of XMSGAPI.  This may
  be added in a future version.

- For applications that do not require SDM support, you may define
  MSGAPI_NO_SDM and recompile the library (remember to do "make clean"
  first!).  Similarly, for applications that do not require Squish or JAM
  support, you may define MSGAPI_NO_SQUISH or MSGAPI_NO_JAM
  respectively.  This will result in a smaller library and consequently
  a smaller executable.

- JAM support has been disabled by default in this version due to
  unresolved bugs and/or incomplete code in api_jam.c.  To reenable,
  remove -DMSGAPI_NO_JAM from your makefile.  Use at own risk.  It may
  corrupt your message base.


Compiling

To generate the XMSGAPI library for your compiler/platform, chdir to the
appropriate directory run your make utility (called "make" for most
environments; "nmake" for Microsoft; "wmake -ms" for Watcom).  If your
C compiler or platform is unsupported, please contact the XMSGAPI
maintainer.
